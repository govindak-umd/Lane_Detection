    Make sure that a folder called 'data' is present in the directory. This folder contains the images neeeded for solving Problem 2
    A sample folder path for all the images that was initially given are:
    'C:\\Users\\govin\\OneDrive - University of Maryland\\UMD DOCS\Semester 2\\ENPM673\\Project 2\\data\\'
    A sample folder path for all the images that were edited and to generate the final video are:
    C:\\Users\\govin\\OneDrive - University of Maryland\\UMD DOCS\Semester 2\\ENPM673\\Project 2\\proj_2_q_2_1\\
    Make sure these two are correctly given
    Also make sure that there is an empty folder called the proj_2_q_2_1. This is where the modified images are going to be added to, before they form the video.
    Make sure that the video containing the car driving in along the path is there in the directory.
    This directory is called data_2.
    The format is similar to: r'C:\Users\nsraj\Downloads\challenge_video.mp4'
    The code will output an improved video and will write it to the directory as well.
